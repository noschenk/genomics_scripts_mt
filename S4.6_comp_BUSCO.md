Installation following instruction on BUSCO web page (takes some time)

from within the location where busco is installed (e.g. ~/programs/busco), run
```
export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/home/exserta/programs/Augustus/config
python3 scripts/run_BUSCO.py -i /home/exserta/Documents/master_project_noelle/data/P.EXSERTA.v.2.0/P.exserta.v.2.0.fasta -o BUSCO_peexv113.out -l /home/exserta/programs/busco/embryophyta_odb9/ -m geno
```
*note*: the environmental variable AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH needs to be set everytime newly, in the same terminal as busco is run. 

the "config" file is from the program "AUGUSTUS", which is required to run the Busco python script (BUSCO program)

-i : the input genome to compare
-o : the name of the output file
-l : where the BUSCO data is stored
-m : which type my data is (here, genome data - "geno")
